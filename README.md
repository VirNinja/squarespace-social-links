## Usage

### Installing Toolbelt

This is a Squarespace web module. To handle the markup, styles, and configuration files in this module, you'll need to install [Squarespace Toolbelt](https://github.com/Squarespace/squarespace-toolbelt) as a development dependency and use its `assemble` functionality.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @squarespace/toolbelt
```

### Using Social Links

Basic usage is as simple as applying the template partial.

```jsont
{@|apply sqs-share-buttons.block}
```

Tweaks are automatically added for:
* Size
* Style (Regular, Border, Knockout, Solid)
* Shape (Square, Rounded, Circle)
* Color

If you want to set a different color for a certain occurrence of the partial, you can use the mixins provided by the LESS file to override the default color:

```LESS
// Using mixin to override color
@custom-social-icons-color: cornflowerblue;
.my-special-container {
  .mixin-template-social-icons-color(@custom-social-icons-color);
}

// Same, but with classname on body
body.is-special-page {
  .mixin-template-social-icons-color-body(@custom-social-icons-color);
}
```
